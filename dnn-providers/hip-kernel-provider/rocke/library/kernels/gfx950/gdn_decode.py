"""GDN/KDA single-token decode kernel instance builder.

For each active sequence and value head, advance one linear-attention decode
step over a fixed-size recurrent state ``S`` (a ``head_v_dim x head_k_dim``
key->value matrix), per the gated delta rule:

    q_hat = l2norm(q) * head_k_dim**-0.5
    k_hat = l2norm(k)
    log_decay_gdn    = -exp(A_log[h]) * softplus(a[h] + dt_bias[h])
    log_decay_kda[d] = lower_bound * sigmoid(exp(A_log[h]) * (a[h,d] + dt_bias[h,d]))
    decay = exp(log_decay)
    beta  = sigmoid(b[h])
    S     = S * decay
    v_new = (v - S @ k_hat) * beta
    out   = S @ q_hat + v_new * dot(k_hat, q_hat)
    S     = S + outer(v_new, k_hat)

GDN uses one scalar decay per value head. KDA uses one decay per K channel and
therefore scales the columns of ``S``. Only gate production and the fade differ;
the remaining recurrence and serving infrastructure are shared.

Only pages named by ``read_indices`` / ``write_indices`` are touched. The
contract is that ``-1`` is the ONLY valid skip sentinel and every active lane
owns a unique write index. Repeated read pages are allowed, and one sequence
may update the page it read; but a sequence must not write a page that
ANOTHER active sequence reads in the same launch (different workgroups would
race on it, in the state pool and in the fused conv-state pool alike). The
host guard does not check that last rule; it does reject any negative index
other than ``-1`` before launch. This code is a lenient superset of that contract: it skips
on ``read < 0 or write < 0``, so on a path that bypasses the host guard
(``validate_indices=False``) a stray ``-7`` is silently treated as a skip rather
than caught. Callers should treat ``-1`` as the only sentinel; the wider test
here is defence, not licence.

Tensors are row-major and contiguous, except the two fused-mode rows noted
below, matching the packed linear-attention decode contract:

    query, key   : [B, 1, num_k_heads, head_k_dim]   dtype
    value, out   : [B, 1, num_v_heads, head_v_dim]   dtype
    a (GDN)      : [B, 1, num_v_heads]               dtype
    a (KDA)      : [B, 1, num_v_heads, head_k_dim]   dtype
    b            : [B, 1, num_v_heads]               dtype
    dt_bias GDN  : [num_v_heads]                     dtype
    dt_bias KDA  : [num_v_heads, head_k_dim]         f32
    A_log        : [num_v_heads]                     f32
    read/write_indices : [B]                         i32
    state        : [pool, num_v_heads, head_v_dim, head_k_dim]  state_dtype (f16/bf16/f32)

The optional fusions (``fuse_conv``, ``fuse_out_norm``; ALGORITHM.md section
4.9) add or replace tensors. ``conv_dim = 2*Hk*Dk + Hv*Dv`` (the spec's
``conv_dim`` property). ``mixed_qkv`` and ``out_gate`` may be row slices of a
wider buffer: their rows are ``qkv_stride`` / ``og_stride`` elements apart and
each row is contiguous; everything else is contiguous:

    mixed_qkv    : [B, >= conv_dim], row stride qkv_stride  dtype (replaces q/k/v)
    conv_state   : [pool, conv_dim, CONV_WIDTH - 1]         dtype
    conv_weight  : [conv_dim, CONV_WIDTH]                   f32
    out_gate     : [B, >= Hv*Dv], row stride og_stride      dtype
    norm_weight  : [head_v_dim]                             f32

Every pointer argument must start at the byte alignment that
``gdn_decode_pointer_alignment`` names for it; the emitted vector accesses
assume it and the host launch path checks it.

**Two emitters, one contract**, selected by ``GdnDecodeSpec.simple``.

``simple=False`` -- the default, and the only path dispatch can reach -- is
**warp-tiled**: ``num_warps * wave_size`` threads per workgroup and
``blocks_per_v_dim`` workgroups per ``(sequence, value_head)``. Each warp splits
the ``head_k_dim`` reduction across ``warp_threads_k`` lanes and recombines with
an XOR butterfly (``quad_perm`` at offsets 1-2, ``ds_swizzle`` wider), so the
unfused kernel allocates no LDS (``fuse_out_norm`` adds a ``num_warps``-float
LDS reduction when ``num_warps > 1``; ALGORITHM.md section 4.9). Dispatch
selects this tile from the gfx950 GDN registry: `auto`
uses a deterministic static priority, while an explicit `spec_id` pins a tile.

``simple=True`` is the v1 reference: one workgroup per ``(sequence, value_head)``,
``head_v_dim`` threads, thread ``t`` owning state row ``t`` (the full
``head_k_dim``-wide key vector for value-dim ``t``) in registers, so every dot
product is thread-local and needs no cross-thread reduction. Q/K L2 norms and
``dot(k,q)`` are recomputed per thread -- redundant but simple -- which makes it
VGPR-heavy by construction. It is **not reachable through dispatch**; it exists
as the correctness baseline the warp-tiled path is validated against, and is
selected only by naming the spec directly (see ``ALGORITHM.md`` section 4.7).

Built for gfx950 (wave64) and placed alongside the KDA chunkwise kernel in
``kernels/gfx950/``; the ``arch`` argument is a validation/target hook, not a
portability claim -- a new arch adds its own tuned specs here rather than
importing across folders.
