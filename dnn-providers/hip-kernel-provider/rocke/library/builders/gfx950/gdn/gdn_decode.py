"""Host-side driver for the GDN single-token decode kernel.

The kernel emitter in ``kernels/gfx950/gdn_decode.py`` produces device code.
This module is everything on the host needed to actually exercise it: compile a
spec, build inputs, run it, judge the result against an independent reference,
and time it.

The reference is deliberately *not* a restatement of the kernel. It evaluates
the gated delta rule with whole-tensor fp32 arithmetic and knows nothing about
the kernel's workgroup mapping, warp tiling or cross-lane reductions, so
agreement is evidence about the algorithm rather than a tautology.

Both outputs are checked. The kernel writes ``out`` *and* mutates the recurrent
state in place; a driver that only compares ``out`` would let a corrupted state
write ship silently, because the state is not read back until the next decode
step.
